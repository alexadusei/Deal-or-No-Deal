# Deal or No Deal
Another project from high school. This one's based on a desktop Java game on the television series "Deal or No Deal".

#Concept
The goal of the game is to get as much money as possible,  roughly between $1 and $1,000,000. You lose money based on what suitcase you choose (which has a random arrangment of money between approximately one and a million dollars). After choosing 6 cases per round, a value of money is generated and you can choose to walk home with that amount (DEAL)  or continue testing your luck by continuing the game by elimiating suitcases with money (NO DEAL). More details on the game show can be found on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_or_No_Deal">Wikiedpai</a>

A simplified version of the algorithm for choosing the monetory amount after choosing 5 cases per round is used for this project.
